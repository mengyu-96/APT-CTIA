## Installation and Execution

### From Source

Start by grabbing this source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/NanArtist/APT-MMF.git
```

### Environment

It is recommended to run this code inside a `conda` environment with `python3.10`.
- Create environment:
   ```sh
   conda create -n APT-MMF python=3.10
   ```
- Activate environment:
   ```sh
   conda activate APT-MMF
   ```

### Requirements

Latest tested combination of the following packages for Python 3 are required:

- PyTorch (2.0.0)
- DGL (1.0.1)
- NetworkX (2.8.4)
- Sklearn (1.2.2)
- NumPy (1.23.5)
- SciPy (1.10.1)


To install all the requirements, run the following command:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution
 
Once the environment is configured and the input data is prepared as described in [emb.md](Attribution/emb/emb.md), the programs can be run by the following command:
   ```sh
    python Main.py
   ```

## Introduction
APT-MMF addresses the insufficient feature extraction and fusion problems encountered in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)-based APT actor attribution research. The main idea is the multimodal and multilevel feature fusion by multimodal node features and multilevel heterogeneous graph attention networks. This repository provides a reference implementation of APT-MMF, including the main programs, various utilities, etc. The execution results of APT-MMF for multiclassification tasks concerning APT actor attribution achieve a Micro-F<sub>1</sub> value of 83.2% and a Macro-F<sub>1</sub> value of 70.5% on a heterogeneous attributed graph dataset contained 1300 APT reports of 21 APT groups.
